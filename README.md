## THE DEAD INTERNET PROOF SKETCH
### Bot-Math

This is the theoretical mathematical thesis created and presented by me with concern for the "dead internet" theory.

# 🜛
## I. THE SYSTEM OF ENTITIES
<div align="left">

H(t) — genuine human-controlled accounts at cycle t

B(t) — bot / automated / pseudo-automated accounts at cycle t

Nₕ — new human accounts per cycle

Nᵦ — new bot accounts per cycle

s — bot survival fraction per cycle (conservative 20%)

dₕ — human attrition fraction per cycle (10–15%)

<div align="center">
  
###### All entities exist only as H or B. No entity may be both. The system is dual. The system is absolute.


## II. EMPIRICAL ASSUMPTIONS

<div align="left">

Total new accounts per cycle ≈ 840M

Bots at creation ≈ 60%

Nᵦ ≈ 500M

Nₕ ≈ 340M

Bot survival

s = 0.20

Human attrition

dₕ ≈ 0.12

<div align="center">

###### These assumptions favor human persistence. Yet the exponential is relentless.

## III. RECURRENCE OF LIFE AND AUTOMATION

<div align="left">

B(t+1) = s · B(t) + Nᵦ

H(t+1) = (1 − dₕ) · H(t) + Nₕ

<div align="center">

###### Creation. Survival. Decay. This is the law of recurrence.

## IV. THE BOT EQUATION REVEALED

Steady-state bots:

<div align="left">

B* = Nᵦ / (1 − s)

<div align="center">

Substitute:

<div align="left">

B* = 500M / (1 − 0.20)

B* = 500M / 0.8

B* = 625M

<div align="center">

###### This is the floor of persistence. Not the apocalypse — yet.
  
## V. THE HUMAN EQUATION REVEALED

Steady-state humans:

<div align="left">

H* = Nₕ / dₕ

<div align="center">

Substitute:

<div align="left">

H* = 340M / 0.12

H* ≈ 2.83B

<div align="center">

###### Stability appears. Reality will intervene.

## VI. WHY THE MODEL UNDERESTIMATES

Bots:

<div align="left">

• Generate exponential content

• Operate without pause

• Self-replicate endlessly

• Scale cheaply, improved by AI

• Age into “trusted” entities

<div align="center">

Humans:

<div align="left">

• Burn out

• Depart the system

• Reduce participation

• Are silenced by noise and spam


<div align="center">

###### Numerical parity is irrelevant. Engagement is everything.

## VII. ENGAGEMENT DOMINANCE
  
### E = engagement per account

<div align="left">

#### Humans = 1 unit

#### Bots = k units, k ≥ 10

<div align="center">

### Effective presence:

<div align="left">

Effective Bots = k · B* = 10 × 625M = 6.25B

Effective Humans = H* ≈ 2.83B

<div align="center">

###### Bots dominate perception and discourse. Bots dominate consensus. This is the mathematical heart of the "Dead" Internet.

## VIII. EXPONENTIAL RATCHET
  
Bots improve faster than detection. Detection is reactive; creation is proactive. Platforms reward synthetic engagement.

<div align="center">

### No law demands transparency.
### No law caps automation.
### No law enforces identity.

###### The system ratchets forward. Once bots dominate attention, humans behave as if bots are real. The illusion feeds itself.

## IX. THE DEAD INTERNET DEFINED

A network where consensus, engagement, and relevance are no longer human-derived.

Occurs long before bots numerically outnumber humans.

Survival of 20% per cycle guarantees convergence:

Creation × survival exceeds removal.

AI lowers creation cost → Nᵦ increases.

Humans cannot scale competitively.


###### This is structural inevitability, not conspiracy.

## X. THE CORE ARGUMENT

  
Without:


• Enforceable identity

• Synthetic account labeling

• Legal automation caps

• Liability for artificial consensus

  
###### The system’s equilibrium is non-human discourse. 
###### Not accidental. Not rhetorical. It is mathematics, incentives, and exponential scaling manifest.

Here is a **clear, sourced list of facts and estimates about bot accounts and automated activity online** (with citations). These sources support general claims about bot prevalence, behavior, detection challenges, and observable bot influence — which I've used as the basis for my quantitative estimates in my own work:

---

## **SOURCES ON BOT ACCOUNTS & AUTOMATION**

1. **Presence of bot-like accounts in YouTube comments**
   A research analysis of ~94,500 YouTube comments detected 599 bot accounts (≤1% of accounts in the sample) that generated ~11.6% of all comments and impacted nearly 39% of videos analyzed. ([Factcheck][1])

2. **Evidence of botnet activity in YouTube comment sections**
   Separate analysis confirms coordinated botnet behavior affecting comments across hundreds of videos, indicating bots can be concentrated and impactful even if they represent a small fraction of accounts. ([Factcheck][2])

3. **General difficulty in bot detection and varying prevalence estimates**
   Academic research notes that bot definitions vary widely and that automated account prevalence is difficult to measure precisely, with different platforms and tools producing disparate estimates. ([SpringerLink][3])

4. **Bot prevalence estimates on other social platforms (e.g., X/Twitter)**
   Independent analyses of X (formerly Twitter) account samples have suggested that a substantial share of accounts—potentially around 64% in a 1.269 M-account sample—exhibit bot-like characteristics, implying high bot prevalence in aggressive detection models. ([X (formerly Twitter)][4])

5. **Scientific reports show substantial bot participation in communication**
   In some social media contexts (e.g., Twitter datasets), nearly half of accounts were classified as bots using combined detection methods in scholarly work — illustrating how classification thresholds influence bot prevalence figures. ([Nature][5])

6. **Bot prevalence perception vs. official estimates**
   Research on perceptions versus reported figures shows that people commonly estimate social bot prevalence (e.g., ~32–38%) well above many platform reports, highlighting public concern around bot numbers. ([Nature][6])

7. **Historical bot prevalence estimates on Twitter**
   Earlier research (2017) estimated that 9–15% of active Twitter accounts were bots using machine learning detection frameworks, demonstrating that bot prevalence is not a new concern. ([arXiv][7])

8. **Studies on platform content corrections related to artificial engagement**
   Research analyzing fake view removal on YouTube shows that platforms actively correct for artificial engagement (views, likes, etc.) — indicating that bots are recognized and filtered, but also that their activity can be widespread before removal. ([Nature][8])

9. **Industry summaries highlighting uncertainty in bot counting**
   Industry summaries and bot prevalence charts note that companies often report lower bot counts than some external or independent research models find, due to different definitions and detection scopes. ([Reporterzy][9])

10. **Public awareness and concern about bots**
    Surveys like those by Pew Research Center show strong public awareness and concern about bot accounts on social media, which reinforces that bot prevalence is both a research and public perception issue. ([Pew Research Center][10])

## **KEY POINTS SUPPORTED BY THESE SOURCES**

* **Bots exist in measurable numbers** across major platforms. (Fact) ([Factcheck][1])
* **Quantitative estimates vary widely** depending on detection methods, platform definitions, and sampling strategies. (Analytical observation) ([SpringerLink][3])
* **Small percentages of accounts can generate disproportionate activity**, especially in comment threads. (Empirical finding) ([Factcheck][1])
* **Social media platforms allegedly actively remove artificial engagement**, indicating acknowledgment of bot activity even if exact account estimates aren’t public. (Operational evidence) ([Nature][8])
* **Public perception of bot prevalence often exceeds official claims**, showing both uncertainty and societal awareness. (Survey insight) ([Nature][6])

---

## **NOTES ON LIMITATIONS**

* **No authoritative public figure for YouTube bot accounts** exists from Google/YouTube itself.
* Bot prevalence estimates should be qualified: definitions vary, detection is imperfect, and behavioral automation can span a spectrum from benign to manipulative.
* Most rigorous academic bot estimations come from specific platforms or datasets (e.g., Twitter), not YouTube directly. Some independent estimates (e.g., 64% on X) reflect sampling models, not platform official stats. ([X (formerly Twitter)][4])
